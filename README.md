Home Assistant integration allows to control the Vogel's MotionMount NEXT 7355 over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).

## High-level description & use cases

This integration exposes the MotionMount as local devices and entities in Home Assistant so you can:

- Move the mount forward/backward and rotate left/right (percentage-based control).
- Call named presets and add/delete presets.
- Set a freeze preset used when the TV is turned off and how the TV status is detected.
- Start the calibration process.

Use cases:

- Move to a named preset when the TV turns on/off or based on another trigger.
- Automatically rotate or adjust distance based on other sensors or automations.
- Expose device status for monitoring.

## Supported device(s)

- [Vogel’s MotionMount NEXT 7355]([https://www.vogels.com/de-de/c/tvm-7675-elektrische-tv-wandhalterung-schwarz](https://www.vogels.com/en-gb/c/motionmount-next-7355-gb-full-motion-motorised-tv-wall-mount))

## Requirements & prerequisites

- Home Assistant **2025.6.0 or newer**
- Bluetooth support on the host (integration depends on HA’s `bluetooth` integration)
- Python package: **`bleak>=0.21.1`**

## Installation

### Recommended: HACS

1. Use the “Open in HACS” badge above.
2. Install the integration from HACS → Integrations.
3. Restart Home Assistant.

### Manual installation

1. Copy the `custom_components/vogels_motion_mount_ble` folder into `<config>/custom_components/`.
2. Restart Home Assistant.
3. Configure via **Settings → Devices & Services → Add integration → Vogels MotionMount (BLE)**.

## Setup

During setup, the integration asks for:

- **MAC** — the BLE MAC address of the device.
- **Device name** — a friendly name for the device.

- The integration can **automatically detect the Mount via Bluetooth**.

> **Note**: Ensure your Bluetooth adapter is working and within range of the mount.

## Data updates

The Vogels Motion Mount integration fetches data from the device every 5 minutes by default.
This is used to keep up to date if automove or other sources like infrared remote control is used.
You can disable it in the system options of your added device.

## Actions

### Action: Set authorised user PIN

The `vogels_motion_mount_ble.set_authorised_user_pin` service sets the authorised user PIN.
Authorised users are allowed to control and change the settings (if there is a supervisior a subset of allowed settings can be configured).

- **Data attributes**:
  - `device_id` — Required
  - `pin` — string, Required
    - **Constraints**: Must be exactly 4 digits, 0000 removes the pin (removing only available if no supervisior is set up)
  - **Example**: `{"device_id": "12345", "pin": "1234"}`

### Action: Set supervisor PIN

The `vogels_motion_mount_ble.set_supervisor_pin` service sets the supervisor PIN.
If set downgrades authorised user to control only, a subset of features can be allowed to be changed by an authorised user.

- **Data attributes**:
  - `device_id` — Required
  - `pin` — string, Required
    - **Constraints**: Must be exactly 4 digits, 0000 removes the pin (setting pin only available if an authorised user is set up)
  - **Example**: `{"device_id": "12345", "pin": "5678"}`

## Example

This example shows how to automatically move the Motion Mount to a preset when the user wants to eat.

```yaml
alias: Move Motion Mount to Dining Room for Meals
description: "Automatically move the Motion Mount to the Dining Room preset when the user wants to eat."
trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: input_boolean.user_wants_to_eat
    to: "on"
condition: []
action:
  - service: vogels_motion_mount_ble.select_preset
    data:
      device_id: YOUR_DEVICE_ID_HERE
      preset: "1" # Preset 1 corresponds to "Dining Room"
mode: single
```

## Known limitations

The Vogles Motion Mount BLE integration currently has the following limitations:

- Setting disabled channel (disabling infrared/ethernet etc) is not yet supported
- Readonly mode is not supported, the integration will always fail to authorize if there is a pin set up in the Vogels Motion Mount because it is expected that a user wants to control the Mount when it is connected to Home Assistant.
- The Mount will disconnect BLE automatically, therefore no permanent connection is possible.
- Checking for software updates is currently not supported.

## Troubleshooting

If you're experiencing issues with your Vogles Motion Mount BLE integration, try these general troubleshooting steps:

Make sure your Vogels Motion Mount is in range, is powered on and properly also the Bluetooth connection is turned on. Validate if your Bluetooth devices can find the Motion Mount via it's exposed discoveries.

It's possible to reset the Motion Mount by removing the cover and pressing on the reset it will blink fast. For any LED error codes check the manual.

## Removing the integration

This integration follows standard integration removal, no extra steps are required.
